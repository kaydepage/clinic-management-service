            <h2>What is Pet Care?</h2>
            <p>Pet care is a fundamental aspect of responsible pet ownership, enhancing the lives of both pets and their owners. It promotes physical, mental, and emotional well-being.</p>
            <p>Along with essentials like feeding and exercise, some pet owners choose to immortalize their beloved companions through pet commission artwork, capturing their unique personalities and creating a lasting tribute to their furry friends.</p>

                <h3>Why is Pet Care Important?</h3>
                <p>Pet care is essential for the following reasons:</p>
        
                <ul class="importance-list">
                    <li><strong>Promotes health and longevity:</strong> Proper pet care can enhance your pet's overall health, increase its lifespan, and prevent diseases or conditions such as dental disease, obesity, and heart conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Supports psychological health:</strong> Caring for your pet helps reduce anxiety and depression in pets. Engaging with them regularly, playing, and showing affection can greatly improve their mental well-being.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strengthens bonds:</strong> Regular interaction, training, and care foster a strong bond between you and your pet. This bond can be emotionally fulfilling for both you and your pet, leading to a happier and healthier life for your pet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevents disease transmission:</strong> Responsible pet care, including regular vet check-ups and vaccinations, can reduce the risk of spreading animal diseases to humans and other animals. This is particularly important for zoonotic diseases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensures comfort:</strong> Pets that are well cared for are more comfortable as their needs are met. This includes a clean living environment, regular grooming, and appropriate nutrition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encourages responsible ownership:</strong> Good pet care practices teach responsibility and empathy. It's a commitment that requires time, resources, and patience, but the rewards are immeasurable.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>In both developed and developing countries, there are several limitations which are holding back access to medicines.</p>
                    <h3>Are veterinary medicines reaching pets in need?</h3>
                    <p>In a survey conducted by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA), three-quarters of veterinary associations surveyed indicated that access to veterinary medical products hampered their ability to meet the needs of their patients and provide quality service.</p>
                    <p>Major reasons cited for lack of access to medicines included the regulatory environment in respondents’ countries, as well as manufacturer-related issues, such as lack of interest due to smaller market sizes and subsequently higher product costs in those markets.</p>
                    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic also impacted access to medicines, despite veterinary practices in many countries being listed as “essential” services and exempt from many closures affecting other industries.</p>

                            <p>Even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy was on the rise among pet owners, hindering progress on pet health.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In the UK, approximately a quarter of pet owners said their dog did not have a primary course of vaccinations when young, despite vaccinations preventing a range of common diseases.</li>

                            <p>More reliable, systemic data is essential to evaluate whether vaccine hesitancy is growing amongst pet owners, particularly in the wake of Covid-19.</p>

                    <h2>Is telemedicine use increasing?</h2>
                    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic saw more veterinary practices offering telemedicine:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A HealthforAnimals survey conducted in fall 2020 found almost half (47%) of pet owners stated their veterinarian offered digital/remote consultations, up from 20% prior to the pandemic.</li>
                        <li>The HealthforAnimals survey found 75% of owners who had a telemedicine consultation said they were ‘satisfied’ or ‘extremely satisfied’ with the service.</li>
                        <li>A survey published in the Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association confirmed these findings, finding that ‘telemedicine substantially increased’ during the pandemic.</li>

                    <h2>What are the hurdles to telemedicine?</h2>
                    <p>A global survey of pet owners conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic revealed that nearly two-thirds, or 60 percent, of pet owners were willing to pay for veterinary advice or consultations via telemedicine services.</p>
                    <p>However, challenges remain in adopting telemedicine practices globally. For instance:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In Brazil, a draft bill to legislate veterinary telemedicine was shelved in 2020, despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic, leaving traditional veterinary services to handle the strain.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Federation of Veterinarians in Europe recommends allowing the use of telemedicine, but more regulatory clarity is needed in many regions to make it a permanent solution for veterinary care.</p>
